1. 
	a) The tutorial used was openvim.com.
	b) The tutorial was completed.

2. vim was used to write the entire homework.

3. :r log.c

// Divides by two until it can't anymore
// returns how many times it had to divide by 2
// log base 2 is rounded down since int is returned and not a floating point
uint32_t logbase2(uint32_t num)
{
	uint32_t sum = 0;
	if(num > 1) sum = 1 + logbase2(num / 2);
	return sum;

	// Creates an array with ten test integers
	uint32_t test[10] = {0,1,2,3,4,8,13,64,100,4294967295};

	// Tests each of the test integers
	for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++) printf("The log base 2 of %u is: %u\n",test[i],logbase2(test[i]));

6. enscript --header='$n %E %*|$%|Spencer Goulette' hw01.txt -o - | ps2pdf - output.pdf

I used this command to create a pdf so that I could print later since I didn't have a printer hooked up.
