SECURITY
What is the most secure OS?
Not really answered but always able to get in

Zoom issues: Zoom Bombings

What is secure? A Human problem that we need to take care of

How Secure
	Password
	Updates
	Services
	Monitor
	Firewall/Filter
	Backup

Good Passwords/Shadow Passwords
	What is good?
		Random Characters -> We forget these -> Write it down!
		4 random 5 letter words -> enough entropy
	
	What makes systems insecure?
		Bad passwords
		Backdoors
		Bad Users
		Physical Security
		Buggy Software/Hardware (Spectur, buffer overflows [didn't check your array size]


	Keep system updated with security patches
		Old days we got patches/compiled code/deploy
			Issues take a long time/patches are buggy!
			For (buggy) patches -> testig non production phase / roll out to prod.

		apt update; apt upgrade

	turn off services
		tftp
		rsh
		telnet
		ftp
		finger
		Make sure you are using
		Use ssh with public key authentication

		Uninstalled:
		AVAHI subsystem - discovering services on a network (REMOVE!)

	firewall
		Filter network traffic
		IPtables - Kernel level firewall (ufw)
		tcp wrappers user space - /etc/hosts {allow,deny}
		sendmail,samba/yp - have applicatio level filtering as well.

	monitor
		Blinky lights
		tripwire
		tcpdump - wireshark, ethereal, ...
		netstat
		hosts
		ps
		nmap - testing network/ports
		John the ripper (crack) password cracker

	backup
		Amanda
		rsync

	Use Encryption! - Regardless... Kerberos

	Trojanized software - ps, ls, netstat -> hacked and modified.
		lrk - linux root kit. ssh (with a backdoor) (user level)
		lk(m)rk - installed at the kernel level -> done for - hiding at kernel level
		"rk" that installs in FLASH firmware.
		poor security (human behavior)
		Make sure you are paying attention to securing systems.
