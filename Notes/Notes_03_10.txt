KERNEL

wwv data structure

wwv_ioctl

gpiod_set_value

Need to do locking so that the gpio pin isn't being toggled incorrectly

Don't want deadlock and race conditions

sleeping in kernel space

/usr/src/linux-4.18.97/Documentation

timers-howto.txt

If in an atomic context
ndelay
udelay
mdelay

Not an atomic context

udelay
usleep_range
msleep_interruptible

msleep_interruptible should be used to do large values

explanations in the timer documentation on which to use

chrome: linux xross reference
bootln - look for stuff there as well

kernel-hacking/hacking.rst
To get data from user space to kernel space
copy functions
put_user
get_user
copy_to_user
copy_from_user

check for errors when things are passed and make sure a valid address
