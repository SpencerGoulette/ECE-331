**** Processes ****
DEFINITION: An abstraction of a (running) program that includes system resources
Every process shares resources -> kernel resource manager
Kernel acts on behalf of the processes
Attributes of processes - PID. Large array in memory uint16_t
ps - list processes in current terminal
ps agxu | more
process 1 is always /sbin/int first process parent of all processes
PIDs have to be unique
IPC Signals
T-Traced/Stopped
S-Sleeping		can be woken up by an interrupt
R-Running
Z-Zombie
I-Idle kernel thread
s-session leader
<-high priority
l-multi-threaded
L-Pages locked in memory
t-debugger
D-uninterruptible sleep
Can find more in man ps

Kill			sends a signal

fork()
wait() 			reaps return value from children

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
	pid_t pid;
	
	pid=fork();

	if(pid>0) {
		printf("Parent\n");
		sleep(60);
	} else if (pid==0) {
		printf("child\n");
	} else {
		printf("fork\n");
	}
}
