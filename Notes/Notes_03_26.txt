Discord Worked

Plan for the rest of the semester
3 more light homeworks
Crank on the Project
Project 3 Moved back a week and a day
Final during finals week
24 Hour take home final
Some python, short answer, who knows

Pass/Fail Option: Complicated
College Engineering is putting together a FAQ about Pass/Fail Option
Professors cant deny the Pass/Fail Option

Class Cancellation: 1/3 of University are stuggling to make things work
Sheaff unsure if Classes will get cancelled for the semester
Getting more done now makes it easier

Questions on the Kernel Driver
Chapter in book that is really helpful? Ch 3, Ch 4, Ch 5, Ch 6, and Ch 8
Timers better documentation for delays that you need
Does the race conditions chapter have information on locking? Yes, and there is also a file in the linux kernel source tree that tells you about locking:
/usr/src/linux/Documentation/locking - documentation on locking

NETWORKING
Ethernet and TCP/IP

ETHERNET
Data Format
"Frames" Octets:
	Preamble:	8 	Synchronize clocks
	Dest Addr:	6	48 bits - Unique address called MAC address (listed as ether)
	Src Addr:	6	48 bits - from address
	Type:		2	16 bits - 0x0800 IP (SPX/IPX - Novell Network)
	Data:		46-1580		
	CRC:		4

TCP/UDP - Layer 4
IP (SPX/IPX) - Layer 3
Ethernet - Layer 2 (layer 3 type in the network layer)
Data - next layer up (IP data or SPX/IPX data)
CRC - Cyclic Redundancy Check 32 bits that verify data integrity
	Error Check - Parity (Serial)

Fragmentation
It is possible as you traverse the network the frame that your host transmits could actually get chopped up into smaller pieces as you transverse the network

Can refer to a large set of computers with a single number

IPV4 uses 32 bit numbers
IPV6 uses 128 bit numbers

32 bits used to be divided into classes (A,B,C,D,E)
130.111.0.0 network - Class B - 65536 total addresses
	130.111.0.0 to 130.111.255.255 => Dotted decimal notation - 32 bit value
		Dots just divide bytes - number range from 0 to 255

	130.111.32.11 -> nameo.its.maine.edu (maine.edu's name server)

Class A - 128 networks with 16 million addresses
Class B - 16k networks with 65536 addresses
Class C - 2M networks with 256 address
... so on

By setting all Dest Addr bits to 1 in Ethernet, you can broadcast on the whole network

32 bit value - Put 1 bits for the network part and zeros for the host part.
Use DDN or CIDR (Classless internet domain routing)

Netmask - one start at the "left" are consecutive until it changes to a zero and then remains zeros. The ones are the network part and zeros are the host.

IP ADDR: 192.168.001.022
NETMASK: 255.255.255.000
bitwise and
------------------------
		 192.168.001.000 -> network address 192.168.1.0
							192.168.1.0/24 (the number of 1 bits)

How many addresses do I have?
Where do we have zero bits in the netmask?
8 zero bits 2^8 = 256 addresses

Assignable? Turns out that the network address is reserved - DO NOT ASSIGN TO A HOST.

For the network we have the host part all zeros. For the broadcast we set the host part to all ones. Again do not assign to a host.

We say that we can have assignable addresses for hosts  - two less than the total number of addresses in the network.

	IP ADDR: 192.168.001.022
~	NETMASK: 255.255.255.000
	bitwise or
----------------------------
			 192.168.001.255 <- broadcast address


Topics:
DNS
Routing
Web Servers
Email
Firewalls
etc.

We need to cover:
Web servers
php
sql
javascript

- Especially for Project 4
